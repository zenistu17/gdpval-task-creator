  REFERENCE FILES - WHAT TO UPLOAD
==========================================

Reference files are the INPUT data that the AI will use to
complete the task. These are the files the AI can see and work with.


*** IMPORTANT: USE PUBLIC DOMAIN DATA ONLY ***

Do NOT create synthetic/fake data. Use real, publicly available
datasets and files. Examples of public domain sources:

- Pexels.com (free stock videos/images)
- Pixabay.com (free stock media)
- Archive.org (public domain content)
- Kaggle.com (public datasets)
- Government open data portals

Using public domain data ensures:
- Legal compliance
- Realistic task scenarios
- Reproducible results


WHAT TO INCLUDE:

- Documents: PDF, DOCX, TXT files
- Data: CSV, JSON, XLSX spreadsheets
- Images: PNG, JPG (for image-related tasks)
- Audio: MP3, WAV (for audio/transcription tasks)
- Video: MP4, MOV (for video editing tasks)


EXAMPLE FOR THE FILM PROMO REEL TASK:

1. raw_clips/ folder with video clips:
   - people_on_phones.mp4 (from Pexels)

TIPS:
-----

1. USE PUBLIC DOMAIN SOURCES ONLY
   All files must be legally usable. No copyrighted content.

2. INCLUDE ALL FILES MENTIONED IN YOUR TASK
   If you say "use the video clips", include the video clips!

3. ORGANIZE WITH FOLDERS
   Group related files: raw_clips/, audio/, fonts/, data/

4. NAME FILES CLEARLY
   Good: "sunset_beach_clip.mp4"
   Bad:  "video_final_v2.mp4"

5. KEEP FILES REASONABLE SIZE
   Large files are okay for video tasks, but don't go overboard.

6. TEST YOUR FILES
   Make sure all files open and play correctly before uploading.
