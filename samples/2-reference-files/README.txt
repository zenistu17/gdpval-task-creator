  REFERENCE FILES - WHAT TO UPLOAD
==========================================

Reference files are the INPUT data that the AI will use to
complete the task. These are the files the AI can see and work with.


WHAT TO INCLUDE:
----------------

Upload any files the AI needs to do the task:

- Documents: PDF, DOCX, TXT files
- Data: CSV, JSON, XLSX spreadsheets
- Images: PNG, JPG (if task involves image analysis)
- Audio: MP3, WAV (if task involves audio/transcription)
- Video: MP4, MOV (if task involves video analysis)


EXAMPLE FOR OUR SAMPLE TASK:
----------------------------

For the "quarterly-sales-report-analysis" task, upload:

1. sales.csv      - The transaction data to analyze
2. products.csv   - Product information for reference

See the example files in this folder.


TIPS:
-----

1. Include ALL files mentioned in your task description
   If you say "analyze the contract", include the contract file!

2. Use realistic data
   Real-looking data makes better tasks (use fake names/numbers)

3. Keep file sizes reasonable
   Avoid huge files - keep data focused on the task

4. Name files clearly
   Good: "employee-records.csv"
   Bad:  "data_final_v2_FINAL.csv"

5. Test your files
   Make sure files open correctly before uploading
