A serene Japanese garden at sunset, with a red wooden bridge arching over a koi pond. Cherry blossom petals are gently falling onto the still water, creating soft ripples. In the background, a traditional pagoda is silhouetted against an orange and pink sky. The scene should evoke peace and tranquility.
