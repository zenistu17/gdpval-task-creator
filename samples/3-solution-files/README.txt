  SOLUTION FILES - WHAT TO UPLOAD
==========================================

Solution files are the CORRECT ANSWERS - what the AI should produce
if it does the task perfectly. These files are hidden from the AI
and used to check if the AI got it right.


WHAT TO INCLUDE:
----------------

Upload the expected output for the task:

- If task asks for a report → upload the correct report
- If task asks for calculations → upload the correct numbers
- If task asks for a summary → upload the correct summary
- If task asks for edited document → upload the correctly edited version


EXAMPLE FOR OUR SAMPLE TASK:
----------------------------

For the "quarterly-sales-report-analysis" task, upload:

1. sales-summary.txt - The correct summary with right numbers

See the example file in this folder.


TIPS:
-----

1. CREATE THE SOLUTION YOURSELF FIRST
   Actually do the task manually to create the correct answer.
   This ensures the task is doable and you know what's expected.

2. BE PRECISE
   The solution should be exact - correct numbers, correct format,
   correct structure. This is what the AI will be compared against.

3. MATCH YOUR TASK REQUIREMENTS
   If your task says "create a PDF report", your solution should
   be a PDF report (not a text file).

4. INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED OUTPUTS
   If your task asks for 3 deliverables, include all 3 files.

5. DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR WORK
   Verify your solution is actually correct! Wrong solutions
   will make the task impossible to pass.
