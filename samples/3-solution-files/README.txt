==========================================
  SOLUTION FILES - WHAT TO UPLOAD
==========================================

Solution files are the CORRECT ANSWERS - what the AI should produce
if it does the task perfectly. These files are hidden from the AI
and used to check if the AI got it right.


WHAT TO INCLUDE:
----------------

Upload the expected output for the task:

- If task asks for videos → upload the correct videos
- If task asks for a report → upload the correct report
- If task asks for analysis → upload the correct analysis
- If task asks for edited files → upload the correctly edited versions


EXAMPLE FOR THE FILM PROMO REEL TASK:
-------------------------------------

For the "film-promo-reel-editing" task, you would upload:

1. viral_vertical.mp4
   - The correctly edited vertical video (1080x1920)
   - 15-30 seconds, with all required elements
   - This is what a perfect submission looks like

2. viral_horizontal.mp4
   - The correctly edited horizontal video (1920x1080)
   - 30-60 seconds, with storytelling elements

3. thumbnail_horizontal.png
   - The correct thumbnail image (1280x720)


TIPS:
-----

1. CREATE THE SOLUTION YOURSELF FIRST
   Actually do the task manually to create the correct answer.
   This proves the task is doable and you know what's expected.
   For a 7+ hour task, this means spending 7+ hours yourself.

2. BE PRECISE
   The solution should meet all the requirements you specified.
   Correct format, correct specs, correct content.

3. MATCH YOUR TASK REQUIREMENTS
   If your task says "create H.264 video at CRF 20", your
   solution must be H.264 at CRF 20.

4. INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED OUTPUTS
   If your task asks for 3 deliverables, include all 3 files.

5. QUALITY MATTERS
   Your solution sets the standard. Make it professional quality
   that demonstrates what a good submission looks like.

6. TEST YOUR SOLUTION
   Run it through the same checks the AI will face.
   Does it meet all technical requirements?
